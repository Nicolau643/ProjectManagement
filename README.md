# ProjectManagement

The goal is to create a project starting with the idea, making a business case, calculate the expected profits and losses and gather all the information that we need to make make the project real and profitable. This project is divided in 5 parts. I will briefly describe them below.

# H1
 - In this assignmet we generally described the project idea. And the idea is to give the oportunity to people that dont have enought money to buy a given product, to rent in a fair price. We discuss about the idea, project summary, project planning, stakeholders, business and market. 
# H2
 - Here we discuss the business case where we formalize the previous assignment adding the major milestones and cost benefit analisys.
# H3
 - In this step we make the Project Charter. We make a summary of the project at this point. Added the deliverables and its dates to deliver.
# H4
 - In this assignment we schedule the tasks(that are in the Work Breakdown Structure) of the project in a Ghantt Chart, made time assumptions, the PERT/CPM network and described the data for the calculation of the budget and discussed the resouces needed.
# H5
